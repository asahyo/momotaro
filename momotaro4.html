Now I am a big boy and I must do something to help my country. In a distant part of the sea there is an island named Ogre Island. Many wicked ogres live there, and they often come to our land and do bad things like carrying people away and stealing their things. So Iâ€™m going to go to Ogre Island and fight them and bring back treasure. Please let me do this.'"</p></div>
